Sure! Here's a basic HTML code block for a page about the Google web browser that can unblock things for school:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Google Web Browser: Unblock for School</title>
    <style>
      body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      }
      h1 {
        color: #4285f4;
      }
      p {
        margin-bottom: 10px;
      }
      .unblock-button {
        padding: 10px 20px;
        background-color: #4285f4;
        color: white;
        border: none;
        border-radius: 4px;
        cursor: pointer;
      }
      .unblock-button:hover {
        background-color: #276db8;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Google Web Browser: Unblock for School</h1>
